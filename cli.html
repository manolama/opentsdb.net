<h2>Command-Line tool</h2>

OpenTSDB comes with a simple command-line tool, <code>./tsdb</code>.
This page documents the various subcommands of the tool.
<div id="toc"></div>

<h3>Common flags</h3>
All the subcommands of the tool accept the following flags:
<div class="code">  --table=TABLE    Name of the HBase table where to store the time series (default: tsdb).
  --uidtable=TABLE Name of the HBase table to use for Unique IDs (default: tsdb-uid).
  --zkbasedir=PATH Path under which is the znode for the -ROOT- region (default: /hbase).
  --zkquorum=SPEC  Specification of the ZooKeeper quorum to use (default: localhost).
</div>

<h3>Site-specific configuration</h3>
The common flags are required by all the subcommands.  It can be tedious to
manually type them over and over again.  You can instead override the default
values in a configuration file, <code>./tsdb.local</code>.  This file is
expected to be a shell script and will be sourced by <code>./tsdb</code>
if it exists.

<h4>Setting default values for common flags</h4>
If, for example, your ZooKeeper quorum is behind the DNS name
"zookeeper.example.com" (a name with 5 A records), instead of always passing
<code>--zkquorum=zookeeper.example.com</code> to the command-line tool each
time you use it, you can create <code>./tsdb.local</code> with the
following contents:
<div class="code">#!/bin/bash
MY_ARGS='--zkquorum=zookeeper'
set x $MY_ARGS "$@"
shift
</div>

<h4>Overriding the timezone of the TSD</h4>
Servers are frequently using UTC as their timezone.  By default, the TSD
renders graphs using the local timezone of the server.  You can override
this to have graphs in your local time by specifying a timezone in
<code>./tsdb.local</code>.  For example, if you're in California,
this will force the TSD to use your timezone:
<div class="code">echo export TZ=PST8PDT &gt;&gt;tsdb.local</div>
On most Linux and BSD systems, you can look under
<code>/usr/share/zoneinfo</code> for names of timezones supported on your
system.

<h4>Changing JVM parameters</h4>
You might want to adjust JVM parameters, for instance to turn on GC activity
logging or to set the size of various memory regions.  In order to do so,
simply set the variable <code>JVMARGS</code> in <code>./tsdb.local</code>.
<p>
Here is an example that is recommended for production use:
<div class="code">GCARGS="-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps\
 -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution -Xloggc:/tmp/tsd-gc-`date +%s`.log"
if test -t 0; then  # if stdin is a tty, don't turn on GC logging.
  GCARGS=
fi
# The Sun JDK caches all name resolution results forever, which is stupid.
# This forces you to restart your application if any of the backends change
# IP.  Instead tell it to cache names for only 10 minutes at most.
UNFUCK_DNS='-Dsun.net.inetaddr.ttl=600'
JVMARGS="$JVMARGS $GCARGS $UNFUCK_DNS"
</div>

<h3>uid</h3>
OpenTSDB assigns various UIDs (Unique IDs) to metric names, tag names and tag
values.  Read more about the <a href="schema.html">schema</a>.  This tool
allows you to query, create and rename UIDs.  Beware that TSDs aren't
expecting UIDs to change, so after renaming a UID you should do a rolling
restart of your TSDs.
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb uid grep metrics 'disk.*write'
metrics iostat.disk.msec_write: [0, 3, -67]
metrics iostat.disk.write_merged: [0, 3, -69]
metrics iostat.disk.write_requests: [0, 3, -70]
metrics iostat.disk.write_sectors: [0, 3, -68]
</div>
You can also lookup the UID of an individual entity, for instance a tag name:
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb uid tagk host
tagk host: [0, 0, 1]
</div>

<p>
If you ever decide to rename something, for instance a metric, you can do so
using the tool, but once again, be advised that TSDs don't expect UIDs to
change names, so you should do a rolling restart of your TSDs after changing a
name:
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb uid rename metrics my.metric new.metric.name
metrics my.metric -> new.metric.name
</div>

<p>
Because UIDs are stored in a separate table (named <code>tsdb-uid</code> by
default), there's a sub-command called <code>fsck</code> to check that the
table is consistent.
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb uid fsck
8668 KVs analyzed in 1709ms (~5071 KV/s)
No errors found.
</div>

<h3>mkmetric</h3>
This tool is used to register new metrics in OpenTSDB.  Although you can also
register new metrics with the <a href="#uid"><code>uid</code></a> tool, using
the <code>mkmetric</code> tool is easier.  Just give it a bunch of metric
names and it'll register them:
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb mkmetric my.first.metric my.other.metric
metrics my.first.metric: [0, 0, -58]
metrics my.other.metric: [0, 0, -57]
</div>

<h3>import</h3>
The import command takes one or more paths in argument and performs a batch
import of all the data points.  If an input path ends with <code>.gz</code>,
the import tool will decompress the file on the fly.  This is a lot more
efficient and is recommended.  If you generate large amounts of data points,
gzip them as you generate them as the import will be a lot faster with a
gzipped input.
<p>
The format of the data accepted by the tool is the same as throughout the rest
of OpenTSDB: metric name, timestamp, value, tags, all separated by a single
space.  Here's a well formed example:
<div class="code">proc.stat.cpu 1297574486 54.2 host=foo type=user
proc.stat.cpu 1297574501 39.6 host=foo type=user
proc.stat.cpu 1297574486 2.66 host=foo type=nice
proc.stat.cpu 1297574501 0.06 host=foo type=nice
proc.stat.cpu 1297574486 5.0 host=foo type=system
proc.stat.cpu 1297574501 1.6 host=foo type=system
</div>
<p>
Important note: batch imports do not go through a TSD, they go directly to
HBase and bypass its WAL (Write Ahead Log).  This results in a 10x speed up
but if an HBase node crashes during the import, the data you imported may
not be stored safely on disk.  In this case, it is recommended to run the
import again to ensure that all the data is imported properly.  Importing
the same data twice is harmless.

<h3>query</h3>
This command allows you to make queries from the command-line.  The query will
not go through any TSD as the command-line tool will read directly from HBase.
The syntax of the query is very similar to that of the
<a href="http-api.html#/q">HTTP API</a> except it uses spaces instead of
colons to separate the different components of a query.
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb query 2011/02/12-22:05 sum rate proc.stat.cpu host=foo type=idle
proc.stat.cpu 1297576227 352.333333 {host=foo, type=idle}
proc.stat.cpu 1297576242 342.800000 {host=foo, type=idle}
<i>[...]</i>
</div>
Note that if you want to integrate OpenTSDB with third-party tools (e.g.
alerting systems, graphing systems), it is recommended to extract data out of
OpenTSDB using the <a href="http-api.html#/q">HTTP interface</a> of a TSD, not
with the command-line tool.  The TSD has much better query performance thanks
to various caches and existing open connections to HBase.

<h3>fsck</h3>
This lets command lets you scan your data and find anything that might be
wrong with it.  It can also fix some errors automatically.
<p>
Its usage is very similar to the <a href="#query"><code>query</code></a>
in the sense that you have to specify a query and whatever data is covered
by this query will be checked.
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb fsck 2011/06/24 2011/06/25 sum proc.meminfo.memfree
<i>[...]</i>
3592067 KVs (in 15288 rows) analyzed in 6212ms (~578246 KV/s)
No error found.
</div>

<h3>scan</h3>
This command lets you scan the HBase table and helps you make sense of all the
binary byte arrays stored in it.  It is useful to try to debug the raw data
stored in the <code>tsdb</code> table.  It can also be used to delete data
from the table, in case you mistakenly imported bad data.
<p>
Its usage is very similar to the <a href="#query"><code>query</code></a>
command, only the output is different and reflects more exactly how the data
is stored in HBase.  It is also more resilient to invalid or corrupted data,
to help you debug such situations should they arise.
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb scan 2011/02/12-22:05 sum rate proc.stat.cpu host=foo type=idle
<i>[...]</i>
[0, 4, 2, 77, 87, 113, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -33, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 76] proc.stat.cpu 1297576200 (Sat Feb 12 21:50:00 PST 2011) {type=idle, host=foo}
  [0, -57] [0, 0, 0, 0, 60, 102, -59, -8]	12	l 1013368312	1297576212 (Sat Feb 12 21:50:12 PST 2011)
  [1, -73] [0, 0, 0, 0, 60, 102, -38, -99]	27	l 1013373597	1297576227 (Sat Feb 12 21:50:27 PST 2011)
  [2, -89] [0, 0, 0, 0, 60, 102, -18, -77]	42	l 1013378739	1297576242 (Sat Feb 12 21:50:42 PST 2011)
<i>[...]</i>
</div>
The first line shows the raw byte array of the row key, followed by its
interpretation.  We can infer that <code>[0, 4, 2]</code> is the metric ID for
<code>proc.stat.cpu</code>.  <code>[77, 87, 113, 8]</code> is simply the 32
bit integer for the timestamp <code>1297576200</code>.  Then the tags:
<code>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -33]</code> is for <code>host=foo</code> and
<code>[0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 76]</code> is for <code>type=idle</code>.
The next 3 lines show the first 3 cells stored in this row.  The first 2 byte
array is the column qualifier, the second byte array is the value.  The 3rd
field is the interpreted timestamp delta from the column qualifier, then
there's a one character flag to tell us the type of value: <code>l</code> for
an integer value or <code>f</code> for a floating point value, followed by the
value itself.  The last numerical value is the timestamp of that data point
(the sum of the base time stored in the row key and the delta stored in the
column qualifier) as well as a human readable version of it.
<p>
<a name="--delete"></a>
The <code>scan</code> command accepts a <code>--delete</code> flag.  If this
flag is present, it will delete rows as it scans them, and print them to the
standard output in a format that is suitable for the
<a href="#import"><code>import</code></a> command.  So make sure you save the
output to a file in case you mistakenly delete too much data and you want to
re-import it back later!  This is also useful to quickly fix up data.  You can
<code>scan --delete</code> it to a file, do some text manipulations on the
file using your favorite editor, and then import it back into OpenTSDB.

<h3>tsd</h3>
This command is used to start a TSD (Time Series Daemon), as is shown in the
<a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> guide.  Here are the flags
specific to this command:
<div class="code">  --async-io=true|false Use async NIO (default true) or traditional blocking io
  --auto-metric         Automatically add metrics to tsdb as they are inserted.  Warning: this may cause unexpected metrics to be tracked
  --cachedir=PATH       Directory under which to cache result of requests.
  --flush-interval=MSEC Maximum time for which a new data point can be buffered (default: 1000).
  --port=NUM            TCP port to listen on.
  --staticroot=PATH     Web root from which to serve static files (/s URLs).
  --worker-threads=NUM  Number for async io workers (default: cpu * 2).
</div>

The <code>--auto-metric</code> command is particularly useful to get started,
so as to avoid having to manually create all the metrics you want to use.  In
the long run, however, it's recommended to not run with this flag to avoid
bogus metric creation caused by buggy scripts, or scripts still under
development.
