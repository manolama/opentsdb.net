<h2>tcollector</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/OpenTSDB/tcollector/">tcollector</a>
is a client-side process that gathers data from local
collectors and pushes the data to OpenTSDB.
You run it on all your hosts, and it does the work of sending each
host's data to the TSD.<p>

OpenTSDB is designed to make it easy to collect and write data to
it.  It has a simple protocol, simple enough for even a shell script
to start sending data.  However, to do so reliably and consistently
is a bit harder.  What do you do when your TSD server is down? How
do you make sure your collectors stay running?  This is where
tcollector comes in.<p>

Tcollector does several things for you:
<ul>
<li>Runs all of your data collectors and gathers their data</li>
<li>Does all of the connection management work of sending data to the TSD</li>
<li>You don't have to embed all of this code in every collector you write</li>
<li>Does de-duplication of repeated values</li>
<li>Handles all of the wire protocol work for you, as well as future
enhancements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deduplication</h3>
Typically you want to gather data about everything in your system.
This generates a lot of datapoints, the majority of which don't
change very often over time (if ever).  However, you want fine-grained
resolution when they do change.  Tcollector remembers the last value
and timestamp that was sent for all of the time series for all of
the collectors it manages.  If the value doesn't change between sample
intervals, it suppresses sending that datapoint.  Once the value does change
(or 10 minutes have passed), it sends the last suppressed value and timestamp,
plus the current value and timestamp.  In this way all of your graphs and
such are correct.  Deduplication typically reduces the number of datapoints
TSD needs to collect by a large fraction.  This reduces network load and
storage in the backend.  A future OpenTSDB release however will improve on
the storage format by using RLE (among other things), making it essentially free
to store repeated values.

<h3>Collecting lots of metrics with tcollector</h3>

Collectors in tcollector can be written in any language.  They just need to
be executable and output the data to stdout.  Tcollector will handle the rest.
The collectors are placed in the <code>collectors</code> directory.  Tcollector
iterates over every directory named with a number in that directory and runs all
the collectors in each directory.  If you name the directory <code>60</code>,
then tcollector will try to run every collector in that directory every 60
seconds. Use the directory <code>0</code> for any collectors that are long-lived
and run continuously. Tcollector will read their output and respawn them if they
die. Generally you want to write long-lived collectors since that has less
overhead. OpenTSDB is designed to have lots of datapoints for each metric (for
most metrics we send datapoints every 15 seconds).

<p>If there any non-numeric named directories in the <code>collectors</code>
directory, then they are ignored.  We've included a <code>lib</code> and
<code>etc</code> directory for library and config data used by all collectors.

<h3>Installation of tcollector</h3>

You need to clone tcollector from GitHub:
<div class="code">git clone git://github.com/OpenTSDB/tcollector.git</div>

and edit 'tcollector/startstop' script to set following variable:
<div class="code">TSD_HOST=dns.name.of.tsd</div>

<p>
To avoid having to run <code>mkmetric</code> for every metric that
tcollector tracks you can to start TSD with the <code>--auto-metric</code>
flag.  This is useful to get started quickly, but it's not recommended to
keep this flag in the long term, to avoid accidental metric creation.
</p>

<h2>Collectors bundled with <code>tcollector</code></h2>

The following are the collectors we've included as part of the base package,
together with all of the metric names they report on and what they mean. If you
have any others you'd like to contribute, we'd love to hear about them so we can
reference them or include them with your permission in a future release.

<h3>General collectors</h3>

<h4><code>0/dfstat.py</code></h4>
<p>These stats are similar to ones provided by <code>/usr/bin/df</code> util.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>df.bytes.total</code> total size of data
<li><code>df.bytes.used</code> bytes used
<li><code>df.bytes.free</code> bytes free
<li><code>df.inodes.total</code> total number of inodes
<li><code>df.inodes.used</code> number of inodes used
<li><code>df.inodes.free</code> number of inodes free
</ul>
These metrics include time series tagged with each mount point and the
filesystem's fstype. This collector filters out any cgroup, debugfs, devtmpfs,
rpc_pipefs, rootfs filesystems, as well as any any mountpoints mounted under
<code>/dev/</code>, <code>/sys/</code>, <code>/proc/</code>, and
<code>/lib/</code>.

<p>With these tags you can select to graph just a specific filesystem, or all
filesystems with a particular fstype (e.g. ext3).

<h4><code>0/ifstat.py</code></h4>
<p>These stats are from <code>/proc/net/dev</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>proc.net.bytes</code> (rate) Bytes in/out</li>
<li><code>proc.net.packets</code> (rate) Packets in/out</li>
<li><code>proc.net.errs</code> (rate) Packet errors in/out</li>
<li><code>proc.net.dropped</code> (rate) Dropped packets in/out</li>
</ul>

These are interface counters, tagged with the interface,
<code>iface=</code>, and <code>direction=</code> in or out. Only
<code>eth<i>N</i></code> interfaces are tracked. We intentionally
exclude <code>bond<i>N</i></code> interfaces, because bonded
interfaces still keep counters on their child <code>eth<i>N</i></code>
interfaces and we don't want to double-count a box's network traffic
if you don't select on <code>iface=</code>.

<h4><code>0/iostat.py</code></h4>
<p>Data is from <code>/proc/diskstats</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>iostat.disk.*</code> for per-disk stats</li>
<li><code>iostat.part.*</code> for per-partition stats (see note
below on different metrics, depending on if you have a 2.6 kernel
before 2.6.25 or after.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/iostats.txt">iostats.txt</a>
</p><code>/proc/diskstats</code> has 11 stats for a given physical device.
These are all rate counters, except <code>ios_in_progress</code>.
</p>

<pre>       .read_requests       Number of reads completed
       .read_merged         Number of reads merged
       .read_sectors        Number of sectors read
       .msec_read           Time in msec spent reading
       .write_requests      Number of writes completed
       .write_merged        Number of writes merged
       .write_sectors       Number of sectors written
       .msec_write          Time in msec spent writing
       .ios_in_progress     Number of I/O operations in progress
       .msec_total          Time in msec doing I/O
       .msec_weighted_total Weighted time doing I/O (multiplied by ios_in_progress)
</pre>
<p>in 2.6.25 and later, by-partition stats are reported the same as disks.
</p><p>NOTE: in 2.6 before 2.6.25, partitions have only 4 stats per partition
</p>
<pre>       .read_issued
       .read_sectors
       .write_issued
       .write_sectors
</pre>
<p>For partitions, these <code>*_issued</code> are counters collected before requests
are merged, so aren't the same as <code>*_requests</code> (which is post-merge, which
more closely represents represents the actual number of disk transactions).
</p><p>Given that diskstats provides both per-disk and per-partition data, for
TSDB purposes we put them under different metrics (versus the same
metric and different tags).  Otherwise, if you look at a given metric, the data
for a given box will be double-counted, since a given operation will increment
both the disk series and the partition series.  To fix this, we output by-disk
data to <code>iostat.disk.*</code> and by-partition data to
<code>iostat.part.*</code>.

<h4><code>0/netstat.py</code></h4>

<h4><code>0/nfsstat.py</code></h4>
<p>These stats are from <code>/proc/net/rpc/nfs</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>nfs.client.rpc.stats</code> RPC stats counter</li> It tagged with the
type (<code>type=</code>) of operation. There are 3 operations:
<code>authrefrsh</code> - number of times the authentication information
refreshed, <code>calls</code> - number of calls conducted, and
<code>retrans</code> - number of retransmissions

<li><code>nfs.client.rpc</code> RPC calls counter</li>
It tagged with the version (<code>version=</code>) of NFS server that conducted
the operation, and name of operation (<code>op=</code>)
<p>
Description of operations can be found at appropriate RFC:
NFS ver. 3 <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1813">RFC1813</a>,
NFS ver. 4 <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3530">RFC3530</a>,
NFS ver. 4.1 <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5661">RFC5661</a>.
</p>
</ul>

<h4><code>0/procnettcp.py</code></h4>

These stats are all from <code>/proc/net/tcp{,6}</code>. (Note if
IPv6 is enabled, some IPv4 connections seem to get put into
<code>/proc/net/tcp6</code>).  Collector sleeps 60 seconds in between
intervals. Due in part to a kernel performance issue in older kernels
and in part due to systems with many TCP connections, this collector
can take sometimes 5 minutes or more to run one interval, so the
frequency of datapoints can be highly variable depending on the
system.  <ul> <li><code>proc.net.tcp</code> Number of TCP connections
</ul>

<p>For each run of the collector, we classify each connection and
generate subtotals. TSD will automatically total these up when
displaying the graph, but you can drill down for each possible total
or a particular one.  Each connection is broken down with a tag for
<code>user=username</code> (with a fixed list of users we care about
or put under "other" if not in the list). It is also broken down
into state with <code>state=</code>, (established, time_wait, etc). It is also
broken down into services with <code>service=</code> (http, mysql, memcache,
etc) Note that once a connection is closed, Linux seems to forget
who opened/handled the connection. For connections in time_wait,
for example, they will always show user=root.  This collector does
generate a large amount of datapoints, as the number of points is
(S*(U+1)*V), where S=number of TCP states, U=Number of users you
track, and V=number of services (collections of ports).  The deduper
does dedup this down very well, as only 3 of the 10 TCP states are
generally ever seen.  On a typical server this can dedup down to
under 10 values per interval.

<h4><code>0/procstats.py</code></h4>
<p>Miscellaneous stats from <code>/proc</code>.</p>
<ul><li><code>proc.stat.cpu</code>  (rate) CPU counters (jiffies),
