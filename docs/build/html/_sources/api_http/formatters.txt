Response
--------

The response is an array of formatter objects. Each object has the following fields:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Field Name", "Data Type", "Description", "Example"
   :widths: 10, 10, 60, 20
   
   "formatter", "String", "The name of the formatter, suitable for use in the query string ``formatter=<formatter_name>`` parameter", "xml"
   "formatters", "Array<String>", "An array of methods or endpoints that the formatter implemnts to convert response data. These usually map to an endpoint such as ``/api/suggest`` mapping to ``Suggest``. If the formatter does not implement a certain method, the default formatter will respond.", """Error"",""Suggest"""
   "parsers", "Array<String>", "An array of methods or endpoints that the formattter implements to parse user input in the HTTP request body. These usually map to an endpoint such as ``/api/suggest`` will map to ``Suggest``. If a formatter does not implement a parser, the default formatter will be used.", """Suggest"",""Put"""
   
This endpoint should always return data with the JSON formatter as the default. If you think the TSD should have other formatters listed, check the plugin documentation to make sure you have the proper plugin and it's located in the right directory.
